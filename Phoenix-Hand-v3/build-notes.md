# Phoenix Hand v3 Build Notes

## Parts Used

All printed parts were made using a Prusa i3MK3S printer. TECBEARS 1.75mm PLA-BLK was used for all printed parts. Parts were printed at 130% size. All additional parts were purchased from the "Phoenix Hand by e-NABLE Assembly Materials Kit" on the 3DUNIVERSE website. A generic plastic glue was used to attach the nylon cable to the relevant points on the device (3M Scotch-Weld Plastic & Rubber Instant Adhesive).

## Printer Settings

The exact printer configurations are listed in the `printer-config.ini` file in this directory. A 0.1mm layer height was used. I opted to use 15% infill instead of the recommended 30-40% infill as I wanted to save filament and only intend to use this paticular device for badge approval.

## Images and videos

Images of the hand can be found in the `images` directory of this repository. I have also created a short video of the finished build:

## Difficulties

### Printing the palm without supports

I was able to print the palm without supports, although it did leave some stringy artifacts at the roof of the inside of the part, where the overhang was worst. I was able to remove these artifacts with some sandpaper.

### Loose Pins

I found that some of the pins were loose and could be jiggled out (with some effort) after the device was completed. I measured the pins and confirmed that they had been printed at 130% scale as was done with all printed parts. I could bind those pins into place with plastic glue but I decided against it just in case I ever needed to repair part of the hand.

### Documentation

I found the documentation labeled "Right Hand" on the e-NABLE hub page lacked enough detail to allow complete assembly of the hand, neccesitating a video tutorial as well. The first video tutorial I used was vague about some steps, requiring me to switch to a second video tutorial. Through that second video tutorial I also found a link to the Unlimbited Phoenix Hand Thingiverse page which contained a helpful wiring diagram.

## Recommendations

This was a relatively smooth and enjoyable build process, and I am thankful to the e-NABLE community for their design work and for the documentation they have created. I have only a few suggestions.

### Remove "Video 1"/"Assembly Video" and replace with "Video 2"

I started building this device while watching "Video 1" but quickly moved to "Video 2" due to issues with the quality of the first video. I found that "Video 1" did not adequately explain the intended goal of thermoforming the palm and provided no direction on how to shape the foam inserts. It also did not explain which size of plastic dental band to choose. I found "Video 2" on the e-NABLE hub page (by the "Ransom Makes" channel) to be much more informative. I think that the "Ransom Makes" video should be the tutorial linked on the Thingiverse page, and that "Video 2" and "Video 1" should be switched so that assemblers choose the more informative video first.

### Include a wiring diagram

I was quite confused by the wiring until I found the Thingiverse page for the Unlimbited Phoenix Hand which included a wiring diagram. The Phoenix Hand v3 should have a wiring diagram on its e-NABLE hub or Thingiverse pages.

### Improved written documentation

Helpful video tutorials were provided, but the image-only "Right Hand" assembly instructions were not enough to assemble a hand on their own. It would be helpful to future builders if text documentation could be provided for this build to compliment the images. I have found a [Phoenix V2 assembly guide](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/dd/6b/45/30/fc/Phoenix_v2_assembly_guide.pdf) in the links below the second video tutorial with this sort of information, but I have not found an assembly guide for the Phoenix V3. If a guide like that does exist it would be helpful to put it in a more accessible place.
